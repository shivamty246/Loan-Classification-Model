# Loan-Classification-Model
A loan classification model is a sophisticated model based on machine learning in which I apply the different algorithms like SVM, logistics regression, decision tree, and KNN and find the best one by using performance evaluation methods.
TECH STACK and LIBRARIES used in this model are Python, data visualization tools, numpy, pandas, and scikit learn.
WORKING:
First of all, I have got the dataset from Kegel and performed the EDA (exploratory data analysis), where I have done data visualization using bar graphs and pie charts, converted the categorical data into numerical data using One Hot Coding, and extracted the useful insight from the model to get maximum accuracy.

After that, I have performed the training and testing of the dataset, where the whole dataset is split into two parts: test data and train data. The model is trained and tested using different machine learning algorithms like SVM, logistics regression, decision tree, and KNN and generates a confusion matrix of each algorithm, which includes the Jaccard score, log loss, and f1 score to provide the performance and accuracy of the algorithms.

RESULT:
After performing all these evaluations, I have come to the conclusion that decision trees perform better with 95% accuracy, but logistic regression outperforms in tests and suffers from over-fitting
